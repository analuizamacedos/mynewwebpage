Hello! :blush: 

It refers to the development of my new website and my new attempt with HTML and CSS.

Previously I've tried to create my webpage, however I was pretty much lost in this programming world, however I'm currently aware of my goals and interests :four_leaf_clover: . 

It will be a place that I'll share my academicals and personal projects. 

Steps:

Basically I'm recycling my previous sketch in HTML and fixing the sctructure, also improving the CSS part. 
I'll change the additional pages and make them look "cleaner". 
This version, at first, is going to be only in english. 

This bio will change 0_0 . :hibiscus:
