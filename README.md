# mynewwebpage
It refers to the development of my new website and my new attempt with HTML and CSS.
Previously I've tried to create my webpage, however I was pretty much lost in this programming world, however I'm currently aware of my goals and interests. 
It will be a place that I'll share my academics and personal projects.
